Task 1. Which team won the league in Season 1?
The winner in Season 1 is Miami with 138 points.

Task 2.At what point in the season did that team secure their league title?
Miami secure the title in Gameweek 50 in Season 1

Task 3. What result was the biggest upset?
The biggest upset is the draw between Miami and Milwaukee which is evident from the odds of 23.35 for a draw and the rank difference at the end of the season where the two teams are separated by 25 places (right top corner in Fig.1)
